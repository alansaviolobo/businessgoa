Image_upload is a image module for Drupal based on the upload module and inspired by the imagefield module.

Features:
* AJAX upload and deleting of images
* Thumbnail generation
* Categories
* Thumbnail creation
* File previews.
* Lightbox2 integration.
* Views2 integration. (requires views 6.x-2.0-rc2 or later)

NOTE: If you want lightbox2 integration in views, be sure to select the " Link this field to the full image." option!

Images are added as $node->images[FILE ID], and have a term_name property which you can use.

For example, for displaying a "Default" category, you can use

foreach($node->images as $fid => $image) {
  if($image->term_name == 'Default') {
    echo $image->img_html; // HTML for the image thumb, when clicked shows the full image (uses lightbox2 if available)
  }
}

Installation
************
Enable the module in your modules page, then go to the Image Upload settings page (in Admin => Site Configuration).
You will see further instructions there (You should probably add some categories and assign them to your node types).

Troubleshooting
***************
1) Views display "broken handler" for image_upload fields.
Clear your views cache. 

Enjoy!
